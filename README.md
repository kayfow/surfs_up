# Surfs Up Analysis

# Overview of Project

## Purpose
In order to pitch W. Avy's grand idea, they have asked that we run analytics of weather data in Hawaii, on the isalnd of Oahu, where they will open up their Waves of Icecream, surf and shake shop. Providing weather data, will not only help W. Avy start up their business, but also put them in a great position to gain more investors in their company. 

## Summary + Results:
Seen below, June has warmer temperatures with a minimum of 64 degrees Fahrenheit and a maximum of 85 degrees Fahrenheit, while December has cooler temperatures of 56 degrees Fahrenheit minimum to a maximum of 83 degrees Fahrenheit. 

For both, the standard deviation of temperature ranges 3.5-4 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Finally, June's temperatures average in the mid 70s while December's temparates average in the low 70s.

Further information and additional data to collect would be the following:
* Total number of thunderstorms/lightning/extreme weather conditions that may impact surfing conditions and therefore, would impact icecream sales
* Most popular months that icecream is bought
* Popular flavors of icecream in the area
